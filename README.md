# eRRoR-Lang
This is the public repository for the development of the esolang called eRRoR Lang for my undergrad capstone project.

Acceptable tokens:


TO-DO:
	Design the syntax of the language (Current development on a google doc)

	Figure out how to get a ".er" file to execute the compiler with the name of
	the ".er" file.

	Create the compiler for the language
		Create the Lexer to create tokens
            Re-learn classes and why my variables aren't working.
            Open a file and read it line by line to create tokens.
            Write these tokens into another file.
        Decide if it is going to translate into c++ code or assembly language
        code
